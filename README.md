# 🧠 Persona-Aware PDF Summarizer  
### Adobe India Hackathon 2025 – Round 1B

This project is a submission for **Round 1B** of the Adobe India Hackathon 2025.

It implements a smart document understanding system that takes in:
- a **persona** (e.g., Travel Planner),
- a **task or job to be done** (e.g., Plan a 4-day trip),
- and multiple **PDF documents** (e.g., travel guides, restaurant info, cultural tips)

...and returns a clean, ranked, and summarized JSON of the most relevant content.

---

## 🚀 What This Project Does

Given a real-world problem framed as:
- a **persona**
- a **job to be done**
- a folder of **PDFs**

➡️ It performs the following steps:

1. **Extracts text** from each PDF page  
2. **Ranks each section** based on how relevant it is to the given persona + task  
3. **Deduplicates** similar titles  
4. **Summarizes** top-ranked content using a fast, lightweight transformer model  
5. **Outputs** a structured JSON with extracted insights

## 🧪 Example Use Case – Travel Planner

This project supports multiple test cases. Here's an example:

**Persona**: Travel Planner  
**Task**: Plan a 4-day trip for 10 college friends  
**Input PDFs**: Travel tips, hotel guides, cities, things to do in the South of France  
**Output**: Top 5 most relevant sections with summaries in `output/result.json`

You can inspect this example in the `input/` folder provided.

## 🐍 Python Version

This project is tested on **Python 3.10**.  
Please make sure you're using Python 3.10+ for compatibility with packages like `sentence-transformers` and `transformers`.

## ✨ Sample Output Structure

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "persona": "Travel Planner",
    "job_to_be_done": "Plan a trip of 4 days...",
    "processing_timestamp": "2025-07-28T13:01:22..."
  },
  "extracted_sections": [ ... ],
  "subsection_analysis": [ ... ]
}
```

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* **Python 3.10**
* `PyMuPDF (fitz)` – PDF parsing
* `sentence-transformers` – Semantic ranking (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`)
* `transformers` – Summarization model (`sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6`)
* `json` – Structured input/output
* Clean modular design using virtual environments
  
---

## 📌 Notes

* Only the top 5 deduplicated sections are included in the final output (based on ranking).
* The summarizer is lightweight and fast — ideal for hackathon use.
